# UAS Mission Planner — Handoff

## Current status

- Repository: https://github.com/Hunter3304/uas-mission-planner (public).
- Local directory: `D:/Aostfalia/develop/uas-mission-planner`.
- Iteration 001 completed the CLI acquisition -> save -> verified reload loop.
- Iteration 002 implements the user-approved demonstration interface: layers, statistics, feature inspection, and downloads.
- Milestone #2; issues #14 (API), #15 (React), #16 (verification/docs). PRs #17 and #18 merged into iteration/002; their feature branches were deleted locally and remotely and verified.
- Final verification and sprint integration are in progress under #16. Update this status after the main merge.
- Local real-data browser check passed with 91 features; six automated browser tests passed, as did frontend lint and production build.
- No subsequent sprint is approved; discuss its plan before creating it.

## Local commands and demonstration

- Install dependencies: `uv sync --project backend --locked` and `npm ci --prefix frontend`.
- Run tests: `uv run --project backend --locked pytest backend/tests -q`.
- Command help: `uv run --project backend --locked uas-planner --help`.
- Reload live sample: `uv run --project backend --locked uas-planner inspect data/braunschweig-demo`.
- Sample files: `data/braunschweig-demo/features.gpkg` and `metadata.json` (excluded from Git).
- GitHub CLI: `D:\Aostfalia\app\GitHubCLI\bin\gh.exe`, version 2.101.0, authenticated as Hunter3304. It is invoked by absolute path; no global PATH change was made.
- See README and `doc/iteration/iteration-001/feedback.md` for commands and limitations.

## Agreed architecture

- One repository with clearly separated `frontend/` and `backend/` directories.
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, and Leaflet.
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, and a reusable Python research core.
- Frontend and backend run separately. The frontend calls the backend through HTTP APIs.
- The Python core must not depend on the frontend or FastAPI; experiments can call it directly.
- Initial geospatial stack: OpenStreetMap, OSMnx/Overpass, GeoPandas, Shapely, and pyproj.
- Initial storage: GeoPackage, GeoJSON exports, and JSON metadata.
- Local development with VS Code; GitHub provides version control and automated checks.
- Default language for code, project documents, issues, and pull requests: English.

## Required workflow

1. Read this file before starting work and verify it against the actual repository state.
2. Discuss each new sprint plan with the user before creating the sprint.
3. Record the agreed plan in `doc/plan/iteration-NNN.md`.
4. Represent each sprint with a GitHub Milestone and an `iteration/NNN` integration branch.
5. Create each Issue and assign it to its Milestone before creating its feature branch.
6. Create feature branches from the corresponding iteration branch.
7. Validate changes and merge feature pull requests into the iteration branch. Close the corresponding Issue explicitly if necessary; retain its history. Immediately delete the merged feature branch both locally and on GitHub, following the mandatory cleanup procedure below.
8. Validate the complete sprint and merge the iteration branch into `main` through a pull request.
9. Prepare sprint feedback in `doc/iteration/iteration-NNN/` and update README before the sprint merge. Record post-merge facts or further feedback through a documentation update as needed.
10. Update this file at the end of every work session, including incomplete or blocked sessions.

### Mandatory post-merge branch cleanup

- Applies to every merged feature branch and temporary documentation/fix branch, including the branch used to change this document.
- Verify that the intended PR is merged before deleting its source branch. Never delete a branch with unmerged work merely to make the branch list shorter.
- Switch to the target branch and synchronize it, delete the source branch on GitHub, and delete the corresponding local branch.
- Run `git fetch --prune origin` to remove stale remote-tracking references.
- Verify both `git branch -a` and `git ls-remote --heads origin`. Do not report cleanup as complete based only on a PR merge or the local branch list.
- Keep `main`. Iteration integration branches such as `iteration/001` are separate from feature branches and remain historical references under the current convention; changing their retention requires an explicit user decision.
- For squash merges, Git ancestry alone may not mark the local feature branch merged. Confirm the merged PR and synchronized changes before deleting that local branch.

## Documentation locations

- `doc/plan/`: agreed sprint plans.
- `doc/iteration/`: sprint outcomes and retrospectives.
- `doc/decisions/`: architecture and technical decisions.
- `doc/research/`: literature notes and experiment methodology.

## Open questions and pending decisions

- No new sprint is approved. Discuss subsequent scope with the user before creating it.
- Runtime baseline is approved and validated: Python 3.13.13, Node.js 24.14.1, npm 11.11.0, uv 0.11.6. Git is 2.45.1.windows.1.
- OSMnx may retry after service backoff without an overall deadline; Ctrl+C cancels acquisition. HTTP timeout is not a total execution limit.
- Geometries are complete source features, not clipped. Invalid geometries are retained and counted. Unknown tags are preserved as JSON-compatible values.
- Acquisition timestamps may describe a cache read, not the original source download/edit. Source snapshots require preserving the local dataset.
- Frontend and read-only API are implemented. Acquisition remains a CLI operation; refresh the UI after saving new data.
- The current API loads and verifies complete small datasets per request; large-data performance remains future scope.

## Session outcome

- Built a read-only dataset API and React/Leaflet explorer with statistics, feature details, and complete-dataset exports.
- Added browser regression checks and expanded CI to lint/build/test the frontend.
- Documented local launch, data root configuration, offline basemap behavior, and current limits in README and Iteration 002 feedback.
- Finish integration, close the milestone, and record branch cleanup before ending this session.

## Start the interface

Run from the repository root in two terminals:

```powershell
uv run --project backend --locked uvicorn uas_planner.api.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
npm --prefix frontend run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5173. Dataset files are local and excluded from Git. See README for acquisition and verification commands.
